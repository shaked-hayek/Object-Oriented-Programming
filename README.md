## Design choices
* Flying and energy - add

## BONUS
* We created the avatar as a penguin, and added different animations for flying, jumping, walking and 
standing.
* Because the avatar is a penguin, we made the ground in a snow color, and added snowflakes falling 
randomly from the sky and fades out when touching the ground, just like snow.
* We added an energy text bar, with different colors for different energy values.
