## Tree choices


## Design choices
* Avatar's energy reduction - We felt that subtracting energy only when the flying keys are pressed seemed 
less optimal. We wanted to reduce energy as long as the avatar is in the sky and not jumping - because this
is the time he is actually flying. So we decided to regard flying time as all time after the flying keys were
pressed and avatar didn't collide with anything and energy is still not 0.

## BONUS
* We created the avatar as a penguin, and added different animations for flying, jumping, walking and 
standing.
* Because the avatar is a penguin, we made the ground in a snow color, and added snowflakes falling 
randomly from the sky and fades out when touching the ground, just like snow.
* We added an energy text bar, with different colors for different energy values.
