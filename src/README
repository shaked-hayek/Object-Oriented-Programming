## package oop.ex6.main
Sjavac - The main class, responsible to manage exceptions catching and printing correct message, managing the
         file streams and calling the validator classes.
LineValidator - Manages first pass on the file lines. Verifies each line in the given code and saves the
                global information about global variables and methods.
MethodValidator - Manages validation for each method and it's content.

################# Design Choices ################
#################################################

We chose to have the main class responsibility be to print errors and information about the program outcome.
Also we chose that it will be the only part in the code that is responsible on opening and managing the file
stream.

We chose to have two classes that manage each a single pass on all the text. We wanted to have a first pass
to validate each line, and process lines that are outside of methods and method declarations. That way we
can ignore the location of global variables and methods, and save them in the relevant data structures.
We wanted to have a second pass only on the content of the methods. This is why we created LineValidator that
validate each line independently, and we created MethodValidator that validates each method in it's context.

We chose to have a Scope class that held all of the information about it's scope. It holds a hash map that
maps all variable names to it's variable object. This way a scope can know what are the variables defines in
it. We had GlobalScope extend Scope and add it's own functionality of saving the methods in the scope.
It has a hash map that maps method names to their object.
The hash map in both class was chosen to allow fast access to the object by name, whenever we needed to check
whether or not a method or variable existed in the scope.
We also chose to have Method extend scope, because it's a type of scope. It has added functionality of having
a list of variables type that it expects to get on the method call.
If and while blocks are represented by scopes as well.

We chose to handle the different variable types using a factory in class VarTypeFactory. This was to hold
the single choice principle. Only this class knows and gets all the different types.
In it we also have the method assignTypesMatch that connects the different types that can be assigned to one
another.
In order to have VarTypeFactory be the only class that knows all the different variable types, we wanted it
to handle the validation of value assigned to variable. At first we thought to have a method or class for
each var type, but we decided to use functional interface instead, because the different types were had
different actions, and it was a shorter code this way. So the method getValValidationFunc returns a predicate
for each variable type that uses regex in order to verify the value.
In order to have an object for the types without having a class for each of them we added an enum of the
different types.

Variables class is a class that handles the variables lines of declaration and assigment. Variable class
represent a single variable and it's data - it's parent scope, variable type, is it final and is it
initialized.

############ Questions from exercise ############
#################################################

### Exceptions - report in your README file how you handled s-Java code errors in this exercise:
We chose to create an SjavacException class that all other exceptions extend.
We chose to have a general exception class for each issue group, and have a specific message for each
specific error.
We chose to throw the exception in the place that it was detected, and only catch it in the main Sjavac
class, where we printed the exception class name, the message and the line / method name in which the issue
occurred. We chose to print the error with this additional information in order to make it easier for users
to find the error.
At first we thought we should have a different Exception class for each different case of invalid text in the
file. But we soon found out that there are many different reasons for exceptions and that it is better to
create a class for each general type of problem, and let the classes that throws those exceptions add a
relevant error message. That way we managed to have less classes, we managed to allow the users to get more
specific information about the error occurred, and also give the throwing class the responsibility to
specify the problem occurred.

### How would you modify your code to add new types of variables (e.g., float)?
If we wanted to add a new type of variable, all we had to do was add to the Enum (VarType) the name of the
type, and add to the class VarTypeFactory the new type - that would require:
 * Adding the type to the switch statement in the getType method
 * Adding a regex pattern that checks a valid value to this type
 * Adding the getValValidationFunc method a lambda expression that checks this regex
This is an implementation of the Single Choice principle, because there is only one main object that knows
all of the different types. Adding a new type requires change in that class alone.
The types doesn't appear anywhere else in the project, besides the class VarTypeFactory and the enum VarType.

### Modifications/extensions we would have to make in our code to support these additions:
## Using methods of standard java (i.e System.out.println)
In order to allow using standard methods, we can add a class of StandardJavaScope extending GlobalScope,
that loads all of the methods in the standard library to the methodHashMap. We will need to create for each
a Method object that specifies it's expected parameters.
Then we can just have the globalScope check the map of StandardJavaScope as well when looking for existing
methods (at getMethodFromMap method). That will be the only change necessary in order to allow this addition.
## Classes
In order to support classes we could add another class that extends GlobalScope.
We had Method receive general parent scope (and not necessarily the global scope) so that it is irrelevant
for the method what is it's parent scope. We did the same with the variables. Because of that, the addition
of classes requires no change in the Method and Variable classes.
We will only need to add to the LineValidator an option for processing class declarations, and creating the
object of a class.

### REGEX -  please describe two of the main regular expressions you used in your code:
All of the regex patterns in our program are compiled only once for efficiency.
1. The regex pattern for a valid name of a variable: "([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*|_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)".
This regex only matches a name that starts with a letter and then can contain letters, numbers and _, OR
starts with _, but doesn't matches _.
In order to do that we divided the pattern into 2 parts with or on between.
2. The regex pattern for a valid double value: "([\+|\-]?\d+\.?\d*)|([\+|\-]?\d*\.?\d+)".
We had to allow matching of few different options -
* Having zero or one + or - sign at the beginning, that is why we had the expression [\+|\-]?. The ? allows
one or zero.
* Having a numbers with dot in the muddle, beginning or end but not allowing a dot alone. We chose to capture
that with allowing two options, where in both we must have at least one number.
We also wanted to capture the group chosen. That is why we put () around the two options.
